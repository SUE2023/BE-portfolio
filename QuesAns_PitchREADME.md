QUESTIONS TO ASK SELF
As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

üë®‚Äçüíª Solo or team üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª?
What do I want to build?
How do I want to build it?
Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?
Do I like what I‚Äôm doing?
When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
Google slide presentation with:
Name of the project
List of team members
Description of the project
Learning objectives
Technologies used
Third services used if applicable
Challenges already identified
Schedule of work (by using Trello or Kanban board or other) - don‚Äôt forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
Mock-ups if applicable
Video Recording of one or more team members presenting the pitch (using the Google Slide presentation)

Web Stack Portfolio Project Criteria
Overview
This paper describes the requirements for the web stack portfolio project.

Project Scope:
Projects must fall into one of the following categories:

Front-end only
Back-end only
Full-stack applications
Mobile applications
AI projects
Static sites are not permitted; projects must demonstrate dynamic functionality.

Timeline:
Projects built before the designated time are not acceptable. Learners must adhere to the specified timeframe the curriculum provides for project development. Learners will have one month to develop, and present their project.
GitHub Commit History:
Learners must maintain a consistent track record of commits on GitHub. Each commit should be accompanied by a standard commit message, providing clarity on the changes made.

Group Contribution:
All project group members are expected to contribute to the codebase actively.
Contributions should be proportional, ensuring fair distribution of workload among team members.
Originality:
Instances of plagiarism will result in consequences, including disqualification from graduation, disengagement from the program, or a flag from Kimba.

Framework Flexibility:
Learners have the freedom to choose any framework they prefer for their project.
Front-end Only Projects:
For projects focusing solely on the front end, learners may use mock API tools to simulate backend functionality.
Backend Only Projects:
Projects focusing exclusively on the backend must include comprehensive documentation of API endpoints.
Documentation:
README.md should include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and an overview of the project architecture.
Demonstration:
The demonstration should provide insights into the project‚Äôs development process and highlight key achievements.
0. The presentation
mandatory
You will present your project individually or as a team on a zoom call.

Your presentation, inclusive of the demo, should not exceed 16 minutes. You are expected to provide the following:

A public GitHub repository for your project.
A Google Slides presentation including:
A brief description of the project and your team.
A breakdown of the architecture and the technologies or third-party services used.
A report of your developments, highlighting your successes, challenges, areas for improvement, lessons learned, and next steps for your project.
A conclusion summarizing your experience.

1. VIDEO DEMO
A few points to consider while preparing your video:

Maximum Video Duration: The video should not exceed 3 minutes, ensuring it is concise and engaging.

Background Music: If you include background music, ensure it‚Äôs copyright-free to avoid potential legal issues.

Voice-Overs: Feel free to use your voice to guide us through your project. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.

Recommended Tools: We suggest using

Recording: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
Editing tools such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
How to share: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. Make sure your video is accessible to the public - On YouTube, it‚Äôs fine to flag it as ‚Äúunlisted,‚Äù but don‚Äôt flag it as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù
Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.

So, let‚Äôs see your creativity in action.

We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.
3. Good use of Version Control
mandatory
You must demonstrate a good understanding of version control through effective use in your portfolio project. This include:

Committing as often as possible
using descriptive and professional commit messages
collaboration through the use of branches and pull requests
2. Quality of presentation and project
#advanced
The complexity, quality and curiosity that you put in your project is important - go beyond your limit and surprise us!
